# Discogs Product Databese to Unas Webstore

I was requested to help out a vinyl store owner with this. The whole project took 15 hours, its main challanges were understanding the semantics of the JSON file the Discogs API provided and formatting it the way Unas' databases are formatted. Unas has several layers of security measures when you modify the database manually which helped me a lot during tests.
